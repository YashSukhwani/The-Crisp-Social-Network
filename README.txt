2. When manually adding friendship / edge, it will always include the central user.
3. Click on friends / users in the ListView to make them the central user.
4. Search User button changes the central user to the user whose name was entered, if that user does exist.
5. The exported file will contain exactly the same instructions as the imported one, in addition to the manual commands made.
